ğŸ§© Problem: 1. Two Sum
Given an array nums and a target value target, 
return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.

"""EXPLANATION"""
"""
We are scanning the list once using a dictionary to remember what number we need to
reach the target.
For each number:
    If the current number already exists in the dictionary d, it means we previously saw a 
    number that needs this one to make the target. âœ… So we return their indices.
    Otherwise, we calculate target - nums[i] and store that as a needed number in d 
    with its index.
