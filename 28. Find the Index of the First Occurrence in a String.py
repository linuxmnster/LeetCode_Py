ðŸ§© Problem: 28. Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String (a.k.a. strStr)
Given two strings haystack and needle, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack.
If needle is not found, return -1.
If needle is empty, return 0.

"""EXPLANATION"""
"""
First, check if needle is longer than haystack â†’ If so, return -1 (can't find it).
Loop through all possible starting positions in haystack where needle could fit.

    Compare substring haystack[i : i + len(needle)] with needle.
    If they match, return i (the starting index of the match).

If the loop ends and no match is found, return -1.
